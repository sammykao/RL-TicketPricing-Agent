# Dynamic Ticket Pricing with Reinforcement Learning  
Tufts COMP 138 – Final Project

This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that dynamically sets ticket prices for live events.  
The agent interacts with a data-driven simulator built from SeatData.io historical ticket sales, learning pricing strategies that maximize revenue and sell out inventory before the event.

The system includes the full RL workflow: data ingestion, environment modeling, agent training, baseline comparison, and visualization.

## 📌 1. Overview

Traditional pricing assumes stable demand curves. Real markets fluctuate based on time, remaining inventory, and prior pricing decisions.  
We frame pricing as a **sequential decision-making problem**, where the RL agent:

- observes: time remaining, inventory, last price, demand rate  
- chooses: raise price, lower price, or keep it  
- receives reward: revenue + bonuses for selling out + penalty for unstable pricing  
- learns a policy that adapts to market behavior  

Two agents are implemented:

1. **Tabular Q-Learning** (discretized state space)  
2. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** (neural function approximation)

Both are evaluated against heuristic baselines.

## 🧹 4. Dataset & Pipeline (SeatData.io)

### Source  
SeatData.io historical event ticket sales.

### Steps  
1. Place raw files in `data/raw/`.  
2. Run:
python data/loader.py

This produces cleaned sequences in `data/processed/`, with:

- aligned timestamps  
- inventory levels  
- historical prices  
- demand rates  
- per-interval ticket sales  

These sequences feed the RL environment.

### Artificial dataset option
We could also generate our own datasets in the event of SeatData.io getting too 
expensive, where we could not only simulate the different events, but also the 
environment where people buy tickets at different times.

---

## 🎮 5. Environment

Implemented in `env/ticket_env.py`.

### **State**

[time_remaining, inventory_remaining, last_price, demand_rate]

### **Actions**
-Δp, 0, +Δp

(or discrete price levels)

### **Demand Model**
q_t = α_t * exp(-β * price_t) + noise

### **Reward**
revenue + sellout_bonus - price_jump_penalty

Episode ends when inventory hits zero or time runs out.

## 🎯 12. Expected Outcomes

The RL agents are expected to:

- beat heuristic pricing on revenue  
- consistently sell out inventory  
- adapt policies to demand shifts  
- reduce price volatility compared to naïve strategies  
- generalize across different event types
